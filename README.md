# ShallowWaters

Python repository of shallow water flow codes for open channels through application of 1D solvers for St Venant Equations

Highly simplified for frictionless channel flow, user can define channel geometry etc

Can be used to develop more complex environmental fluid dynamics models

Also included is Jupyter notebook which highlights the theoretical backgroud as well as a few cases and ideas on how to develop and alter the code
